## Tunnel address calculation
To calculate the tunnel addresses we assign subnets of the IPv4 prefix in three hierarchy levels:
- one /19 for each core router
- one /20 for each direction (uplink or downlink from the perspective of the core router)
  - 0th subnet for tunnels between edge and core
  - 1st subnet for tunnels between core and site
- one /31 for each tunnel link
  - address 0 for upper tunnel partner
  - address 1 for lower tunnel partner
